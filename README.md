# tmux-IRSSI

These scripts setup an attachable/detachable tmux socket that houses
irssi. Additianally, it opens a pane of 25 characters wide to streem the
names-list fifo.

This was written a long time ago and should be considered very primitive.
This is loosely based on my tmux-tmx scripts. 

# TODO

* better description and explanation of setup
* explain how this can be used to setup an irc proxy to get around restrictions
